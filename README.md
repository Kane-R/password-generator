# Password Generator

Project Brief:
The client requires a simple random password generator that can produce secure passwords quickly and easily from any device.

Criteria:
When the “Generate Password” button is clicked, the following options are to be offered to the user to input which will then be reflected in the password output (displayed on the screen) provided the inputs have been successfully validated:

1.	Password length between 8 and 128 characters
2.	Whether or not to include uppercase letters*
3.	Whether or not to include lowercase letters*
4.	Whether or not to include numbers*
5.	Whether or not to include special characters*
6.	*At least one type of character needs to be selected

A copy to clipboard button has also been added for enhanced usability.
